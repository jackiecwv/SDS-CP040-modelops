    "# Model Artifact Audit – Car Price Prediction (`model_artifact_audit_JCWV_2025.ipynb`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Author:** Jackie CW Vescio  \n",
    "**Date:** October 2025  \n",
    "**Project:** ML Ops – SDS-CP040 ModelOps Advanced Track  \n",
    "**Artifact:** Provided `model.pkl` (XGBoost pipeline) for car price prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook documents a “sanity check” and audit of the provided `model.pkl` artifact.  \n",
    "As an MLOps engineer, I received only the trained model file and requirements list, with no access to the original training code or dataset.  \n",
    "Here, I:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Examine the model’s input expectations and feature names\n",
    "- Test predictions on several realistic, real-world car examples\n",
    "- Document findings regarding prediction realism and model behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "In production ML workflows, it’s common to be given a model artifact as a “black box.”  \n",
    "Auditing the artifact’s input/output, feature requirements, and prediction logic is a critical step for reliable ModelOps and robust cloud deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Audit Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook documents a thorough audit of the provided model artifact (model.pkl). All API, deployment, and testing pipelines were validated and matched the expected feature set. Despite this, predicted prices for realistic car examples were consistently much higher than real-world values. This suggests the model was trained on a non-representative dataset or with an undisclosed target transformation. As an MLOps engineer, my deployment and audit responsibilities were fully met; model quality is outside the scope of my assignment."
